                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                   <p>Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) are large antelopes native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. They are well-adapted to survive in harsh desert environments, particularly in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.</p>
                   <p>These striking animals are known for their long, straight horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 in). Both males and females have horns, though females' tend to be longer and thinner. Their distinctive black-and-white facial markings and light taupe coats help them blend into their surroundings while staying cool in the desert heat.</p>
                   <p>Gemsbok are herbivores, primarily feeding on dry grasses, leaves, and roots. They have an incredible ability to extract moisture from plants, allowing them to survive in water-scarce environments.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the gemsboks just beyond panda canyon.</p>
